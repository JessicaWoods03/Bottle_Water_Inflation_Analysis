# Bottle Water Inflation Data Analysis
 DU Data Science Tools 1, Analysis of Water Companies Inflating bottle water costs. What is causing water to go up in costs?
 Is it population, supply and demand, or is it something more severe that is not being addressed?
 Are we running out of clean water?
 This was a question I had approached me from a local shopper who complained, 
 
 "Why is my water only 4 dollars this week? It was 5.50 last week, 6.00 the week before?"
 I am using three water companies, Dasani, Aquafina, and Fuji water company. 
 Dasani and Aquafina just filters Michigan tap water, which is actually the most expensive water yet.
 Fuji water comes from Australia Island.
 All three companies use the same recycled plastic.
 Starting 4/20 till 5/11 I will gather data on the cost of water at my local store every day, and compare it to the cost of the stocks of the plastic used, and the cost of the stock information gathered on the scraping of yahoo stocks.
 This data will be cross analyzed with the size of the population and the expected growth on a weekly basis in my area.
 More data will be gathered as we unravel the mysteries behind bottled water inflation costs.
